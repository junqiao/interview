Latency/Consistency/Availablity

Consider some prefixs are not searched before.

Build trie tree and each node in trie tree will store most popular items which has the prefix. 

If the size of data is too large, we need to shard the data by alphabet and use load balancer to distribute data. 


* There are two broad categories for recommendation systems. 1. Content-based recommendation is based on similarity between products such as providing music or video recommendations by genre. Whereas collaborative filtering-based recommendations consider a userâ€™s attributes such as browsing history, page views, clicks, preferences, etc. to deliver the recommendations. Like those suggested advertisements we mentioned earlier. 
* Some aspects to be considered
	'N' means 'need data feed', 'DN' means 'don\'t need data feed'.
	** Popularity - most-viewed pages, most-purchased items, etc. DN
	** Trending - the items that gain popularity in past several days. DN
	** Context - the items that are viewed by the people who also viewed this item/the items that are similar to this item (by title, item category, sku, etc.). build context library. DN
	** Tag - attach tags to user based on his/her view history and recommend based on tags. User can also select the tags they are interested in. DN
	** Interest - for e-commerce, after user select the items they want to buy, we can recommend items based on whatever they selected. N
